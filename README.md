# Slag-Optimization-in-the-Elecroslag-Remelting-Process-Using-Python
Construction of Python function to Design the SLAG in Electro-Slag Remelting through Thermodynamic Modeling

An attempt has been made to optimize slag chemistry used in ESR process through thermodynamic modeling for minimizing the loss of oxidizing elements thereby minimizing inclusions.
In this study it was assumed that homogeneous composition of the alloying elements is maintained throughout the length of ingot but practically there are variations in the compositions due to dynamic conditions
Initially model was validated with experimental data available in the literature and subsequently applied to our ESR grades.

# We can produce homogenous and clean steel refined steel ingot using the model as a guidance to optimise deoxidation technique during the industrial ESR process.
